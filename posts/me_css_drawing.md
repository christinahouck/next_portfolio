## What I did
Made a CSS drawing of Taylor Swift's album cover for her single, "Me!"

## Context
At this point, I was looking for ways to practice my CSS skills. When I saw this album cover, I thought, "I wonder how you could do that with CSS?"

This project taught me some cool things, including CSS' background-clip property.
