## What I did
Built a full-stack site using MongoDB, Express, Node, React, Next.js, Less, and Mapbox maps. The site allows users to search for tattoo shops in Washington State based on location, color, and style.

## Context
When a family member was looking for a tattoo artist, I was shocked to see how he did it: browsing Instagram tags for the style that he wanted, hoping to find someone whose style he liked in his area.

At the time, I was purely a front-end developer, but wanted to learn how to build my own API, so I started learning and applying it to my own API. I worked on it slowly over nights and weekends for about a year before launching an alpha version. It's not perfect, but the basic SLC functionality is there.

I have a high regard for my users' privacy, so I'm using a GDPR-friendly, no-cookie, lightweight analytics tool called TinyAnalytics.

I plan to continue to develop this site, adding new features such as authentication, image uploading, reviews, and many more tagged shops.
