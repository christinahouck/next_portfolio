## What I did
Won the People's Choice Award at the 2019 Faithlife Hackathon

## Context
My company runs a hackathon every summer. Developers, marketers, designers, interns, and more are invited to form groups and participate in a 24-hour contest.

My team built a smart color picker for our website builder. Users could upload an image, such as their logo, and it would create a color palette for them based on the images in the photo.

At this point in my career, I didn't have access to the codebase that we were contributing to, and at the time, getting access and building the code for the first time was fairly cumbersome. Instead, I brought my marketing skills to the table by creating the digital displays and a coding a product landing page, which were meant to show the judges that the feature has real business value.

## Business impact
The feature that we built was incorporated into the product almost immediately, and it made customers happy that they could generate color palettes this way rather than building them themselves or selecting a palette that didn't fit their style.
