## What I did
Learned Three.js by building a not-to-scale model solar system.

## Context
I was interested in learning a 3D library, so I read through some Three.js docs and started to learn what I could do. After building and animating a few cubes and other shapes, I realized that I could build a sort of model solar system (albeit not at scale), using [NASA's planet imagery](https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html).

This was a fun project for me to get my feet wet with a new technology that interested me.
