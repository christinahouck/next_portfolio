## What I did
Wrote the majority of the UI for a cornerstone feature in a major product release, using React, Less, styled-components, and react-query.

## Context
The main product that I work on is a text editor similar to Microsoft Word or Google Docs, but highly focused toward writing sermons.

This product is just part of a large, multiplatform software called Logos Bible Software.

I collaborated with a few teammates: one who wrote the back-end support for this feature, one who handled the drag and drop UI, and a UI/UX designer.

The feature that I added was a way for pastors to search for popular quotes that may relate to their sermon content. They can do so by selecting some text from within the editor and clicking on a button, or by typing their search term into an input box.

## Business impact
This feature is utilized by tens of thousands of users each week.

It's available on our iPad, Mac, Windows, and web apps, and is well-loved as a tool that solves a real problem for pastors and Bible teachers, allowing them to spend less time writing their sermons and more time doing ministry and being with their families.

It's also gotten very few bug reports since its release.
