## What I did
Made a CSS drawing of Rick from the Adult Swim cartoon, Rick & Morty.

## Context
I had seen other CSS drawings on Twitter and wanted to try one on my own. I chose Rick because he's comprised of mostly simpler shapes such as ovals and straight lines, but he also has interesting features that I didn't know how to create with CSS, such as curved lines, semicircles, and triangles.

During this project, I learned new ways to use positioning techniques as well as how to fake a triangle shape using borders.
