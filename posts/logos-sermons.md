## What I did
Managed the rebranding work for sermons.logos.com, a Redux/React/Radium app. I updated the site's single sign-on authentication to use the company's newest standards, pioneering some of the work for express/node-based apps. I also updated local and global styles, og data, and more, as well as cleaning up legacy code wherever possible to make future styling updates easier.

## Context
The company is rebranding many of the product offerings for the church from Faithlife to Logos. Since I have experience doing big rebranding and style updating projects in the past, I volunteered to take this case. It required lots of attention to detail, tracking down edge cases, and finding those hidden crevices of the website in order to make updates.

A challenge that I faced during this project was updating to the company's newest redirect-based single sign-on authentication. All of our apps that use this are written in C#/.NET, so the workflow is significantly different. I read docs, consulted with senior engineers when I got stuck, and made edits to the express utilities library in order to get the new auth to work.

## Business impact
This site is crucial to the company's strategy in upcoming years, and aligning the branding and authentication with the rest of the company is our first step in better integrating our disparate products.
