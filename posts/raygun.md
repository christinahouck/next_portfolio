title: 'Raygun Bug Count Project'

## What I did
Led a project to reduce my team's Raygun bugs, resolving all bugs that impacted more than 50 users in a trailing 6-month period.

## Context
My manager mentioned that he'd like to work on getting our bug count down, but he didn't have the time to do so, so I identified the top priority bugs in Raygun to fix, based on number of users impacted within a 6-month period. Then I created Jira cases for each case. I ended up taking on the majority of them myself, fixing the bugs, and shipping the fixes.

## Business impact
One of my company's engineering goals was to reduce net new bug count, so in accordance with that, I headed up this project. It greatly reduced our bugs, sending us about 5 points in the right direction (measured in story points created versus story points resolved).
